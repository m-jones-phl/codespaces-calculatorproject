# PROJECT REVIEW

# I was inspired to build this program because i struggle alot with math , amd currently im learning about rectangles and angles so i decided it would be great to
# just collaborate both of my classes.

#  A roadblock for me was coming up with the idea , then my second issue was webscraping and finding the right webstites and videos.

#  I dont wish to change anything but I would love to make another type of calculator , maybe for two step equations.
